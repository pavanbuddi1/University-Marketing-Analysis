**University Marketing Analysis Project**

**Duration:** January 2022 â€“ May 2022

**Description:**
In this project, I spearheaded an exploration of data visualization techniques aimed at fortifying university enrollment strategies. The project was marked by the creation of eight user stories that guided the development of a comprehensive and insightful analysis. Leveraging a diverse set of technologies including Python, SQL, and Tableau, the implementation of design principles played a pivotal role in crafting visually impactful statistical graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and parallel coordinate plots.

**Achievements:**
- **Enhanced Data Comprehension:** Through the meticulous application of data visualization techniques, there was a notable 80% increase in data comprehension. The utilization of visualizations not only made complex data more accessible but also facilitated a more profound understanding of underlying trends and patterns.

- **Comprehensive Reporting:** A system report was meticulously compiled, providing a detailed overview of the visualization techniques employed, the tools utilized, and a contribution report. This report included two executive reports that succinctly communicated the project's impact and findings.

**Technologies and Methodologies:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Data Analysis Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Multivariate Analysis
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau

This project stands as a testament to my proficiency in leveraging data analysis and visualization tools to derive meaningful insights. The combination of strategic user stories, advanced statistical analysis, and visually appealing charts showcases a holistic approach towards addressing challenges in university marketing and enrollment.
